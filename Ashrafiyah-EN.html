                of the architectural and artistic masterpieces in the Rasulit
                era (628-856 H/1229-1442), which became the city of Ta'izz as
                its capital, the Madrasa had been built by the will of King al-
                Ashraf II, Ismail ibn al- Abbas, who took power after his father
                al- Abbas for the period (778 -802 H/ 1376-1400). Since 1400, it
                became the burial place of the royal family. And it housed a

                colorful murals in particular for damage due to limitations of
                time and neglect for long periods and interventions are not
                suitable for the purpose of maintenance and protection of the
                building, where he led those interventions and rainwater leaks
                to discredit large parts of the general appearance of the
                building from the inside, though, the appearance General held
                many aesthetics as it is possible the restoration of those parts
                and re-aesthetic appearance to the public by those previous

                        In 1978, rescue works had been implemented by inserting
                        reinforced concrete beams in the walls under the domes'
                        drums and lentils of the prayer hall. This intervention
                        caused a loss of more than 105 long meters of
                        inscriptions and plant motifs. A reinforced concrete
                        beams also been inserted on the top of the shrines
                        courtyard and a column as well outside the prayer hall.
